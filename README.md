The code you have provided is a simple web application that allows users to view a video and see the number of views it has. The application also has a page for admins to manage the viewers.

The index.php file is the main page of the application. It loads the video and displays the number of views. It also has a form for users to enter their name. If the user is an admin, they will be redirected to the view.php page.

The view.php file is the admin page. It displays a list of all the viewers and allows admins to delete them. It also has a button to delete all the views.

The delete_views.php and delete_viewers.php files are used to delete the views and viewers from the database.

The config.php file contains the database connection details.

The bootstrap.min.css and jquery-3.6.4.min.js files are required for the styling and functionality of the application.

Here are the steps on how to run the code:

1. Download the code from GitHub.
2. Create a new database and import the wefsa.sql file.
3. Open the index.php file in a text editor and change the database connection details to match your own database.
4. Upload the files to a web server.
5. Open the index.php file in a browser.

You can now view the video and see the number of views. If you are an admin, you can also manage the viewers.
